# What we offer:

We combine data science with product development to help you  
use your data the best. By quick testing of ideas, proof of  
concepts and risk analysis, we help you minimize the risk of  
investment and guarantee to only promise what the data allows  
us to.  

We take your bussiness seriosly. By combining your domain  
knowledge, our data science knowledge and close collaboration  
during the projects, we guarantee quality. By clear  
visualisations and direct communication, we keep you up to  
date at all phases of the project and maybe even help you  
learn something new on the way!

# What makes us different from our competitors:
* We use probabilistic machine learning techniques  
whenever possible.
  * Probabilistic methods also estimate the error  
  in prediction. This way you can be sure that the  
  model does the right thing with the right accuracy.
  * Probabilistic methods help to understand the  
  data better.
* We love open source. We even develop it ourselves.  
By using open source, we minimize the licence costs  
that often do not provide any extra value.
* In data science, the timespan from the theory  
to practice is short. We have strong academic  
background and know the newest directions in  
the research. This way we can guarantee to  
deliver only the best.
